    <h2>Alumni Success Stories</h2>
    <p>
      Our alumni are living proof of what dedication and perseverance can achieve. From excelling in global tech giants 
      to leading innovative startups, they carry the legacy of our institution across industries and continents. 
      Their journeys inspire juniors to dream big, break barriers, and believe that with the right skills and determination, 
      success is within reach. They continue to guide and support the next generation through mentorship, knowledge-sharing, 
      and industry connections, proving that success is not just individual but a shared legacy. For every junior, 
      these stories are a reminder that the path from campus to career is filled with possibilities waiting to be seized.

      The Government engineering college Idukki (GECI) starts functioning at Painavu, the Idukki headquarters, to impart 
      technical knowledge in various fields of engineering. The campus is presently operating at Kuyilimala, surrounded 
      by scenic beauty and pristine forest. Since its inception in 2000, GECI completes 20 years of successfully generating 
      graduates and postgraduates in various disciplines. Within 20 years, more than 5000 students have completed their 
      graduate and postgraduate courses. The GECI alumni association functions in the college to build strong relations 
      between the passed out students and the alma mater. The alumni association is in the process of preparing a database 
      of GECI alumni. The students who have passed out from GECI can be a part of this alumni association by filling out 
      the registration form. Request all of you to be a part of this process.
