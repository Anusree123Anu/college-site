    <h3>Overview of placement activities:</h3>
    <p>
      In the 2024â€“25 academic year, Career Guidance and Placement Cell (CGPC) of Government Engineering 
      College Idukki received 41 offers and placed 35 students through the recruitment drives of 21 companies. 
      For the IT Department, placements were significant in a variety of companies: 1 student (Adithya S.S) 
      got placement in Infosys, 1 student (Diyamol A.P) in Mitsogo, 1 student (Gokhul H.U) in Cognizant, 4 students 
      (Uishma Priya Salin, Anjaly Babu, Abhirami K.S, and Biswas Sekhar) in Talrop, and 1 student (Jomol Jose) in Techmahgi, 
      reflecting a good distribution of opportunities in IT services and product development companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from these confirmed placements, IT students were also actively engaged in drives of key recruiters 
      like TCS, UST, Algomox, and 6D Technologies, thereby increasing their exposure further. Their efforts made 
      sure IT students were properly prepared, leading to an even-placed placement season with representation 
      in both multinational organizations and startups.
